# Student Housing B.V
Student Housing BV owns a building where students can stay during their study in the Netherlands. Their buildings are composed of rooms, where each student gets their own room, and shared facilities such as toilets, a bathroom, a kitchen, etc. 
Students have to communicate about dividing tasks, as the shared facilities regularly need cleaning. These tasks can include cleaning the bathroom, cleaning the kitchen, doing the garbage and buying the groceries. There was no way yet to check 
who had which task and if their task was done or not. They received multiple complaints about students who did not complete their tasks

Our software solution to arrange the day-to-day situation with tasks. This solution will not only help divide tasks and remind students to complete them, 
but also offers solutions to other issues, such as scheduling a party, students can properly view house rules at any time, students can also make agreements between each other and ask the housing company questions and file complaints at any time, anonymously.
The most important role of this software solution is that there will be a way for the housing company to check if students are actually following the rules and completing their tasks.
